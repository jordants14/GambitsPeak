Gambit's Peak is a text based adventure game. You play as a character that you create and name yourself. Once a name has been
chosen. You wake up from being unconcious to realize that you are in the cave of a wizard. This wizard rescued you from a 
battle where you could have been killed. The battle knocked out your past memory but as time goes you, you remember
that you have been chosen by your village to defeat the evil kingwho has been starving your village and threatening 
to harm your people.

Note: The storyline is not complete yet. I spent most of the time alloted for our project on creating to code to make the 
program work. Future iterations will have a completed game and storyline.

Requirements Attempted to Complete:
1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, 
including choosing to exit the program

2. Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent.

3. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.

4. Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file.
(My program records save game file data and writes it to a save text file on the user's computer.


Known Bugs/Issues:
1. When you try to "Quit Game" from the shop menu, it throws an unhandled exception that prevents the game from running until
the user manually locates the save game file stored on their computer and delete the save game folder entirely, then restart
the program.

2. Grammar issues and mistakes.
